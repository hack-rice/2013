			<h1>Judging and Prizes</h1>

<p>Teams will have an opportunity to present their applications on Sunday evening to the audience and a panel of judges representing sponsors as well as Rice professors. We will not judge code quality or style. However, it is recommended that you write clear and readable code to enable your team to work more efficiently.</p>

<p>1st ($150/member), 2nd ($100/member), and 3rd ($50/member) places will be judged with regards to UI, functionality, and utility. Dr. Wong and Dr. Cutler as well as guest judges from our sponsors will be </p>
