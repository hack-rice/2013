    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul class='rules-list'>

    <li>
        <strong>Will there be prizes?</strong><br>
        Over $6000 in prizes will be awarded. Cash prizes will be awarded to first, second, and third place winners. We will also have "24-hours of prizes" where a random participant is awarded a random prize every hour.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Will there be free food?</strong><br>
        Yes! We will provide catered meals during the event along with free caffeine!</li>

    <li>
        <strong>What if I'm not very experienced in programming?</strong><br>
        We will try our best to point people in the right direction and use tools and languages that allow rapid development with the least amount of frustration. There will be upperclassmen participating in the hackathon who can help you out. Furthermore, you can look up tutorials and sample code online.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to bring my own laptop?</strong><br>
        Yes. Unfortunately, we can't provide computers or equipment. Please bring a computer with you and whatever software you feel might be necessary for development. For example, if you plan to make an iOS application, make sure you have a developer license and Xcode downloaded. We also recommend that you bring power strips for convenience. Teammates are free to share equipment with each other.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to form teams before the event?</strong><br>
        You don't have to form a team before the event. At the start of the event, we will provide plenty of time to break out and form the teams. In fact, team registration doesn't happen until 9pm on Saturday.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to stay for the entire 30 hours?</strong><br>
        Nope, we are not a lock-in. We realize that 24 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments or even want to shower or sleep. Feel free to stay and leave as you choose. However, we would prefer that people stay to promote the collaborative environment.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to be present for the awards and judging?</strong><br>
        We would require that at least 1 person from your team be present to demonstrate the application for judging and awards.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>My question isn't answered here! Help?</strong><br>
        Send us an email at ricehackathon@gmail.com or contact our Technical Events Chair, Peter Washington, at <a href="mailto:peterwashington@rice.edu">peterwashington@rice.edu</a>.</li>
